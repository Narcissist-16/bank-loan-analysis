# Project summary

This repository contains SQL queries, transformation steps, and analysis-ready instructions to build a bank-loan analytics report from the financial_loan dataset. It is designed to run inside MySQL / MySQL Workbench and produces the KPIs and grouped reports used in dashboards: loan counts, funded amounts, received payments, interest & DTI averages, and segment breakdowns (status, month, state, term, purpose, employment length, home ownership, etc.)
